#+TITLE: write-checker

This is a collection of functions and minor-modes to make academic writing easier.
I put this together for myself, but if this is useful for you, please use it!

This is a combination of several previous works:
  * https://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/
  * [[https://github.com/bnbeckwith/writegood-mode][writegood-mode]]
  * [[https://github.com/sachac/artbollocks-mode][artbollocks-mode]]

* Installation
** straight.el
I personally don't use straight.el, so I cannot assure you the recipe below is 100% correct, but it should serve as a start.
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package write-checker
  :ensure t
  :straight (write-checker :type git :host github :repo "Karljoad/write-checker"))
#+end_src

** elpaca
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package write-checker
  :ensure (:host github :repo "KarlJoad/write-checker"
           :branch "master"
           :depth nil))
#+end_src
